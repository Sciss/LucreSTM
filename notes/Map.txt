::::::::::::: Unordered Set/ Map which can be used to lookup Mutable objects :::::::::::::

InMemory
  simple: IntMap[ A ]

Durable
  set/map: allocID
  then read/write <set/map-id> ++ <key-id> --> value
  // we need to be very careful then with Confluent not to use the same key space?

Confluent
  two possibilities : (1) map itself is ephemeral
                             set/map: allocID
                             then getTxn/putTxn like with <set/map-id> ++ <key-id> --> value
                      (2) map itself is confluent

  the easier implementation is (1), and that's the one we need for the live views.
  

to keep the 'namespace' open for other maps, we could just have:

newIDMap ...
readIDMap ...
